## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**alexmbas/alexmbas** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 'The Odin Project' and 'Free Code Camp' as well as finishing up a Full Stack Web Development course through my local community college.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP - I really want to focus on the FUNdamentals before moving on to more advanced languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making connections and mentorship.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with new ideas for projects and any insight into freelancing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Jiu Jitsu!
- âš¡ Fun fact: The famous Pirate "Black Beard" was only active for roughly two years!
